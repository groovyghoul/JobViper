# JobViper Development TODO

This file lists the pending tasks for the JobViper CLI application.

## Current Tasks:

1.  **Implement Searching & Filtering for jobs (Feature 5 from gemini.md).**
    *   This will involve adding new commands or options to existing commands to allow users to search jobs by company, status, or contact type, and filter by date range, stage, or source.
2.  **Implement Dashboard / Stats for quick overview (Feature 6 from gemini.md).**
    *   This will likely be a new command that provides a summary of total applications, interviews, offers, rejections, etc.
3.  **Refine existing features or add more commands as requested.**
    *   This is a general task for future enhancements, bug fixes, or new features based on user feedback.
